## Garou
Garou regenerate their worst **Bashing** or **Lethal** health level every turn **outside of breed form**. If they are in critical condition, they may recover one health state each day spent in their breed form, but doing so prevents them from doing much more than sleep.  Otherwise, they heal as humans do.

Garou are unable to heal **Aggravated** damage with anywhere near the same speed. As long as they are in a form that possesses regeneration and are resting, they heal one health state per day.

In [[Combat]], each turn, the Garou will roll `Stamina` with difficulty 8. The roll is reflexive and does not use your action. Success means the Garou heals as normal. Failure means they do not heal. A botch disables the Garou's healing until they are able to rest.

## Mortals

### Bashing
Bashing damage up to the Wounded level can be cared for without medical skill; these wounds heal on their own, without treatment. Bashing damage beyond Wounded may have deeper consequences. A mortal’s vision or hearing may be altered due to a concussion, she may suffer excruciating pain from internal bruising, or she may experience some other extreme discomfort. These effects can be negated if the mortal receives adequate medical attention.

Once bashing levels reach Incapacitated, mortals fall unconscious, but do not sink below Incapacitated... yet. However, any further bashing wounds are X’d over previous bashing ones, making them lethal. At that point, recovery is handled as lethal damage. In this way, a mortal can be slowly beaten to death

| Health Level    | Recovery Time |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Bruised/Wounded | One hour      |
| Mauled          | Three hours   |
| Crippled        | Six hours     |
| Incapacitated   | Twelve hours  |
### Lethal / Aggravated
Lethal damage of any sort can be deadly — that’s why it’s called lethal. Lethal wounds that go unattended may continue to bleed until the mortal passes out and dies from blood loss. Other dangers can also arise from infection, cellular damage, or broken limbs. (Aggravated damage is considered to be lethal to a mortal.)

Any lethal damage past Hurt requires medical treatment to prevent further harm. Untreated lethal wounds worsen by one level of lethal damage per day. When a mortal sustains lethal damage down to Incapacitated, he’s one health level away from death. If he takes one more wound (whether bashing or lethal), he dies.

If the individual is at Maimed or higher, he may recover with rest over the times listed below. However, if the mortal is Crippled or Incapacitated, no recovery is possible unless he receives medical attention. Indeed, at Incapacitated the individual is comatose at worse and delirious at best, and could still die.

| Health Level  | Recovery Time |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Bruised       | One day       |
| Hurt          | Three days    |
| Injured       | One Week      |
| Wounded       | One Month     |
| Mauled        | Two Months    |
| Crippled      | Three Months  |
| Incapacitated | Five Months   |

## Vampires
A level of aggravated damage may be healed only with a full day of rest and the expenditure of five blood points (though a vampire may, at the end of the full day’s rest, cure additional aggravated health levels by spending an additional five blood points and one Willpower point per extra aggravated health level to be healed). Worst of all, a vampire who loses his last health level due to aggravated damage meets Final Death — his eternal life ends at last, and he goes to whatever awaits him beyond the grave.
