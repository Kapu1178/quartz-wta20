## Garou
Garou regenerate their worst **Bashing** or **Lethal** health level every turn **outside of breed form**. If they are in critical condition, they may recover one health state each day spent in their breed form, but doing so prevents them from doing much more than sleep.  Otherwise, they heal as humans do.

Garou are unable to heal **Aggravated** damage with anywhere near the same speed. As long as they are in a form that possesses regeneration and are resting, they heal one health state per day.

In [[Combat]], each turn, the Garou will roll `Stamina` with difficulty 8. The roll is reflexive and does not use your action. Success means the Garou heals as normal. Failure means they do not heal. A botch disables the Garou's healing until they are able to rest.
