A Garou may roll `Stamina + Primal-Urge` in order to shift into a **non-breed** form. One success is required per form the character goes through. For example, a Garou shifting from Homid to Crinos requires 2 successes, one for Glabro and one for Crinos. The Shift Difficulty is determined by the form the Garou is shifting **out** of. You may spend [[Rage#Using Rage]] to perform a shift without rolling.

Unless they are protected with a Rite of Talisman Dedication, clothes are shredded and possessions are dropped to the ground. Hand-held objects may be held onto (if the form has apposable thumbs), but other objects such as jewelry tend to get lost.

## Partial Shapeshifting
Requires a use of a [[Willpower]] point and success on a `Dexterity + Primal-Urge` roll of difficulty 9. Allows the Garou to change only a portion of her body, such as hands into wicked claws, or paws into human hands.
