| 1         | 10%             | Yes                      | Catatonic Fear: The human faints, or collapses in fear                                                                                                              |
| 2         | 20%             | Yes                      | Panic: The human bolts, trying to put as much distance between himself and the Garou as possible.                                                                   |
| 3         | 18%             | Yes                      | Disbelief: The human retreats to a corner to avoid the “hallucination” until it passes, but doesn’t collapse in fear.                                               |
| 4         | 15%             | Yes                      | Berserk: The human attacks, be it firing a gun (he won’t have enough presence of mind to reload, however), throwing crockery or even leaping at the “monster.”      |
| 5         | 13%             | Yes                      | Terror: Much like panic, except with rational thought. The human is able to think enough to lock doors behind him or to get in a car and flee.                      |
| 6         | 10%             | Yes                      | Conciliatory: The human will try to plead and bargain with the Garou, doing anything possible so as not to get hurt.                                                |
| 7         | 7%              | No, but will rationalize | Controlled Fear: Although terrified, he does not panic. The human will flee or fight as appropriate, but remains in control of his actions.                         |
| 8         | 5%              | No, but will rationalize | Curiosity: These people are dangerous, because they remember what they saw (more-or-less), and they might well investigate the matter further.                      |
| 9         | 1.5%            | No                       | Bloodlust: This human refuses to take anymore. She is afraid but angry, and she will remember the Garou and probably even try to hunt it down.                      |
| 10        | 0.5%            | No                       | No reaction: The human is not the slightest bit afraid or bothered by the Garou. Even Kinfolk aren’t this stoic, so Garou tend to be very suspicious of such folks. |
