### Anarch
1) A member of the Anarch Movement.
2) Any Kindred rebel who opposes the tyranny of elders.

### Anarch Movement, The
The Sect within the Camarilla comprised of Anarchs who want to reform or overthrow the rule of the elders.

### Barrens, The
The areas of a city unfit for life, including graveyards, abandoned buildings, industrial wastelands, and areas of irreversible urban blight.

### Becoming, The
The moment one passes from being a fledgling into “full” vampire status as a neonate. In the Camarilla, one may not Become until her sire deems her ready and gains the Prince’s approval.

### *Book of Nod*, The
A collection of Kindred legend and history.

### Blood Bond
A mystical power over another individual engendered by partaking of a particular vampire’s blood thrice; accepting blood from a vampire is an acknowledgment of her mastery.

### Caitiff
A vampire of unknown Clan, or of no Clan at all. Caitiff are typically of high Generation, where Caine’s blood is too diluted to pass on any consistent characteristics.

### Childe
A vampire created through the Embrace — the childe is the progeny of her sire. This term is often used derogatorily, indicating inexperience. Plural childer.

### Coterie
A small group of Kindred, united by the need for support and sometimes common interests. In the Sabbat, coteries are called “packs.”

### Diablerie
The consumption of another Kindred’s blood, to the point of the victim’s Final Death. Vampires may lower their Generation permanently through this abhorrent practice.

### Domain
The area of a particular vampire’s influence. Princes claim entire cities as their domains, sometimes allowing lesser vampires to claim domain within.

### Elysium
A place where vampires may gather without fear of harm (although some Sects, such as the Sabbat, respect Elysium less than the Camarilla does). Elysium is commonly established in opera houses, theaters, museums, and other locations of culture.

### Gehenna
The rumored Armageddon when the Antediluvians will rise from their torpor and devour the race of vampires and the world.

### Ghoul
A minion created by giving a bit of vampiric vitae to a mortal without draining her of blood first (which would create a vampire instead).

### Inconnu
A Sect of vampires who have removed themselves from Kindred concerns and, largely, the
Jyhad. Many Methuselahs are rumored to exist among the Inconnu.

### Jyhad, The
The secret, self-destructive war waged between the Generations of vampire. Elder vampires manipulate their lessers, using them as pawns in a terrible game whose rules defy comprehension.

### Kindred
The race of vampires as a whole, or a single vampire. According to rumor, this term came about in
the 15th or 16th century, after the Great Anarch Revolt. Sabbat vampires scorn the term, preferring the
word “Cainite” instead.

### Kiss, The
To drink blood, especially from a mortal. The Kiss causes feelings of ecstasy in those who receive it.

### Progeny
All of a given vampire’s childer, collectively.

### Sect
A group of vampires arguably united under a common philosophy. The three most widely known Sects currently populating the night are the Camarilla, the Sabbat, and the Anarch Movement.

### Sire
A vampire’s “parent”; the Kindred who created her.

### Vessel
A source of vitae for sustenance or pleasure, primarily mortal.


# Old Form
The elders typically use these turns of phrase, which have existed since long before the modern nights. One is advised to use these words carefully — in some company, their use may be seen as humorously anachronistic, while in the company of Anarchs, for example, they may be misconstrued as elders’ propaganda.

### Amaranth
The act of consuming another Kindred’s blood, q.v. [[#Diablerie]].

### Cainite
A vampire; a member of the race of Caine.

### Domitor
A ghoul’s master; one who feeds her blood and issues her commands.

# Vulgar Argot
