A once powerful and brave tribe that now resides in Scotland. Their habits of sending young Garou into combat has taken it's toll on their numbers. In the 1st century, the remaining tribe members descended into the depths of the [[The Umbra|Umbra]], supposedly to strike at the heart of the Wyrm. Inside they found the Black Spiral Labyrinth. The Labyrinth turned their minds inside-out, and they reemerged as the [[Black Spiral Dancers]].
