Describing themselves as "Pure" alongside the [[Uktena]] and [[Wendigo]], the honorable and steadfast Croatan are no longer around. They protected their people from the disease and invasion of the White Man, as they came to the Americas. They fell in combat against an Eater-of-Souls, a manifestation of the Wyrm itself. The creature feasted on the starvation and disease rampant among the New World enough to breach the Gauntlet into the physical world.

On the Carolina coast, they sacrificed themselves to protect the land. Overnight, they disappeared, and unlike the [[White Howlers]], were never seen again. How exactly they disappeared is unknown, but all that remains is tales of their heroism and a few stray carvings of their symbol. Though it may sound somber, the Croatan are a reminder the Wyrm can be killed. Or so think the Garou.
