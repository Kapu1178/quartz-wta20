# Reproduction
Garou are born, not made. The offspring of a Garou and another species, either a Wolf or a Human, has a roughly one-in-ten chance of undergoing First Change. The offspring of two Garou is always another Garou, but such mating is against the [[Litany]]. It is possible for a Garou to come from two non-Garou parents, if the Changing Blood is potent enough within their bloodline.

# First Change
First Change is when a Garou first changes into Crinos. Typically occurs within a cub between the ages of 10 and 26. Usually induced during a period of anger or other intense stimulus, but can be as mundane as waking up from dreaming of wolves. Even before First Change, cubs are prone to fits of rage, strange fixations, and odd dreams.

During First Change, a lifetime of frustration, anger, and feelings of anything feeling *wrong*, are unleashed at whatever is in her immediately vicinity. A lucky cub may have a nearby tribe subdue her before too much mayhem befalls those around her. Otherwise, she must find her own way to overcome the Rage, or be lost to madness.

Sometimes, a Kin-Fetch, a werewolf or spirit whose sole purpose to locale pre-Change Garou, may do such. They may rescue or even kidnap the cub prior to her Change, in order for said Change to occur under more controlled circumstances. Some tribes view this as a negative, as they believe the uncontrolled Rage should be understood as early as possible, as it is the nature of the Garou.
