## Delirium
A supernatural fear of shapeshifters instilled in Humanity by the Garou. Upon witnessing a Garou enter their War Form, they are subject to a willpower-based response ranging from fleeing in terror to charging the beast with reckless abandon.

Humans never see Crinos-form Garou for what they really are. They always rationalize them instinctively, concocting elaborate and horrific stories about what they saw. That is, if they even remember it at all.
