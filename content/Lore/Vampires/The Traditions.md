Vampires observe a set of customs that exists somewhere between being coded into their undead natures and a social contract that’s ratified every night among the courts of the Damned. Not every vampire affords the idea of the Traditions the respect they deserve — the Sabbat in particular make bold claims about the flaws of the Traditions and the weak wills of those who hide behind them — but in practice, most vampires observe the Traditions to some extent. This is most true of the Masquerade, for as bold as the Sabbat or Anarchs may be, even they don’t have the concentrated might to stand against a world of mortals who learn the secret that the undead walk among them. Interpreting and enforcing the Traditions is the privilege and responsibility of the Kindred Prince. In some domains, particularly those of non-Camarilla Sects, both the titles and the Traditions themselves may vary, but the core principle is found everywhere: That an undead authority makes the rules and woe to any who feel that they don’t have to heed them.

### The Masquerade
*Thou shalt not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.*
*Doing so shall renounce thy claims of Blood.*

### The Domain
*Thy domain is thine own concern.*
*All others owe thee respect while in it.*
*None my challenge thy word while in thy domain.*

### The Progeny
*Thou shalt only Sire another with the permission of thine Elder.*
*If thou createst another without thine Elder's leave, both thou and thy Progeny shall be slain.*

### The Accounting
*Those thou create are thine own children.*
*Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things.*
*Their sins are thine to endure.*

### Hospitality
*Honor one another’s domain.
When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there.
Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.*

### Destruction
*Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind.*
*The right of destruction belongeth only to thine Elder.*
*Only the Eldest among thee shall call the Blood Hunt.*
