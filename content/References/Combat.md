## Attacking
* For using guns, roll `Dexterity + Firearms`.
* For using hand-held weapons, roll `Dexterity + Melee`.
* For hands, claws, bodyweight, and so on, roll `Dexterity + Brawl`. Some attacks may instead use `Dexterity + Athletics`.

## Defending
Defensive actions are declared at any time prior to the opponent's attack, as long as the defender has an action to use. Alternatively, a [[Willpower]] point may be spent to forgo a planned action and instead take a defensive action. 

### Dodging
Hopefully move out of harm's way. This action requires `Dexterity + Atheltics`. The difficulty depends on the distance required to be out of harm's way, and the nature of the attack in question. Dodging a hand-to-hand strike is easy, difficulty 5. Dodging firearms at close range however, would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, difficulty 9 or 10. Each success on this roll subtracts one success from the attacker's roll. This, the defending character needs to roll at least as many successes as the attacker to get out of the way.

### Blocking
Uses body part to deflect an incoming blow. The roll is `Dexterity + Brawl`, with the difficulty depending on the weapon used. A fist may be 5, while a katana may be 8. As with [[#Dodging]], each success from the defender removes one success from the attacker.

### Parrying
Is essentially blocking but utilizing an object instead of one's body. This roll is instead `Dexterity + Melee`.

### Resolution
Once all attacks have landed, the players determine how much damage each combatant has taken. To figure out how much damage has been inflicted, the attacking player rolls their dice pool against difficulty 6. Each success is one health level of damage.

Really successful attacks inflict more damage. For each success *above the first one* that the player scores on their attack roll, they add one more die to the damage dice pool. (Three successes on an attack would be two additional dice.)

## Damage

| Type       | Marking | Soak Difficulty                                          | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bashing    | /       | 6                                                        | Blunt force trauma, fists, clubs, table legs. Even normal humans heal this fairly quickly.                                                  |
| Lethal     | X       | 6 (Supernaturals)<br>8 (Exceptional humans)              | Sharp weapons, firearms, spiked clubs, barbed wire, chainsaws, so on. Most living things have a hard time healing lethal damage.            |
| Aggravated | \*      | 6 (Garou in non-breed form, and not inflicted by silver) | Severe injury. Garou claws/fangs, vampire fangs, toxic waste, fire, acid, silver on Garou. **Aggravated damage cannot be healed by Garou**. |

## Soaking
To soak damage, roll `Stamina` against the difficulty determined by the damage type. Each success subtracts 1 level of damage from the attack.

# Status Effects

* **Blindness:** A character who's been blinded by injury or darkness cannot [[#Dodging|Dodge]], [[#Parrying|Parry]], or [[#Blocking|Block]]. All other actions add two to the difficulty.
* **Knockdown:** A character who's been knocked off her feet must take an action to scramble back up. If she cannot do so, she may be considered partially immobilized.
* **Immobilization:** If a character has been held down, paralyzed, or otherwise rendered unable to move, any character who attacks them reduces her difficulty by two if the target is still able to move somewhat, or may automatically hit otherwise.
* **Stun:** If — after the soak roll — a character suffers health-level damage that equals or exceeds her `Stamina` rating, she's stunned until the end of the following turn. A stunned character cannot take any actions, except perhaps stumble around in a daze, and attack rolls against her have their difficulty reduced by two.
