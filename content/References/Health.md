| Bruised       | 0            | Character is bruised or winded, but suffers no dice penalties due to damage.                                                   |
| Hurt          | -1           | Character is superficially hurt, but suffers no movement hindrances.                                                           |
| Injured       | -1           | Character has suffered minor injuries, and movement is mildly inhibited (halve maximum running speed).                         |
| Wounded       | -2           | Character has suffered significant damage. He can walk, but he cannot run. At this level, a character may not move and attack. |
| Mauled        | -2           | Character is badly injured, and may only stagger (about three yards or meters per turn)                                        |
| Crippled      | -5           | Character is catastrophically injured, and can only crawl (about one yard or meter per turn).                                  |
| Incapacitated |              | Character is incapable of movement and likely unconscious. A character who takes any more damage at this level dies.           |
| Dead          |              | Character is dead. His pack and sept will mourn him, but he is with the ancestors now                                          |
## Incapacitated

<div style='text-indent:4em'>
The stage before death, incapacitation differs from simple unconsciousness. An incapacitated character is critically wounded and near death. If a werewolf’s Incapacitated health level is filled with bashing damage, she falls unconscious in whatever form she has taken, and heals at her normal rate for that form (see p. 256). She remains unconscious for at least one turn. For each extra turn, she can either remain unconscious and heal, or attempt to wake up. Waking up involves a Stamina + Primal Urge roll (difficulty 4, plus 1 for each marked off health level). Upon waking, a character can take action normally.

<div style='text-indent:4em'>
If a werewolf’s Incapacitated health level is filled with lethal damage, the character reverts to her breed form and collapses. Another level of damage of any kind will kill her unless she channels her Rage into remaining active (p. 256). If she is not injured further, she regenerates very slowly, regaining one health level every eight hours, until she regains consciousness and can shift to a form that regenerates faster (metis are an exception to this rule — see p. 256). This near-death regeneration is the only time a non-metis werewolf regenerates in her breed form, and is the source of many myths about werewolves being immune to gunfire. If the damage that takes a werewolf to Incapacitated is aggravated, she is close to death. The character cannot regenerate unless she channels her Rage to remain active (see p. 256). If she does not do so, she dies in a matter of seconds.

## Death
<div style='text-indent:4em'>
If a werewolf is at the Incapacitated health level and takes one more level of lethal or aggravated damage, she dies. A character who dies is removed from the game; the player must create a new character if she wishes to continue play.

<div style='text-indent:4em'>
An incapacitated werewolf may also be killed by massive amounts of bashing trauma — any blow that deals two or more health levels of bashing damage is enough to kill a dying werewolf. This damage overwhelms the Garou’s regenerative capabilities.
