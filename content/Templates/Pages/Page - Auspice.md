> [!example] Quote
> *"Oh, what you’ve described is technically a plan, I*
*suppose. The sort of plan a drooling, brain-dead savage might*
*create, but still a plan. Hey, easy! I wasn’t talking about*
*you — I was talking about the drooling, brain-dead savages*
*massing on our border. I’ve overheard their plans, and they*
*were largely the same as yours. Perhaps you might like to*
*rethink your approach?"*
